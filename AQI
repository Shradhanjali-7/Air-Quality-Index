The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a vital tool that measures and communicates the level of air pollution in a specific area. By converting complex air quality data into a simple numerical scale, it helps individuals understand the potential health risks associated with outdoor air. This project aims to analyze AQI trends to raise awareness and promote actions for cleaner, healthier air.
